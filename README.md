# Hello! This is eProject group 2.

Introduction: The MoonBay Hotel booking website project aims to create an efficient and user-friendly online platform for MoonBay Hotel, a 3-star establishment located on the picturesque Nam Du Island. With the growing trend of online travel booking, this project seeks to provide seamless access to room reservations, transparent pricing, and exclusive offers, enhancing the guest experience.
